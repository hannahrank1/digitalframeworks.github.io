Week 9 Blog Homework: Running an extractor

So this week was interesting, in that I was not quite sure what I was doing or if I was running the extraction correctly. I looked at three major news sites' politics pages to gauge the number of times a particular candidate's name appears in a headline. I soon realized I'd have a very small data sample from each source - CNN, Fox News and NPR - because I couldn't figure out how to run a scrape of multiple days/pages when most news sites have an auto load feature or a link to more content on a separate page. If I had been able to figure that out, I would have had a more accurate picture of the trends in how much coverage news organizations gives each candidate - if it ebbs and flows depending on the campaign trail schedule, spikes for Trump when he says another wild comment, etc. 

ANYWAY beyond the shortfalls of my abilities with import.io, here's what I found (bearing in mind my methodological problems):

CNN had 67 total posts, the most posts available on one main page. Of all the politics coverage, 66 percent was focused on Clinton and/or Trump - 30 percent 36 percent for Trump. So it was pretty evenly split nearly into thirds, assuming the final third was reserved for general politics talk.

It did surprise me that half of the posts today on NPR's politics page mentioned Trump in the headline, and little less than a third of the posts mentioned Clinton. Fox News' coverage was pretty even, and actually had fewer posts overall with the candidates' names in the headlines: 24 percent had Clinton and 28 percent had Trump.  From a spot check I could see that some headlines mentioning Clinton were decidedly more negative than neutral. 

If you look at the raw numbers, I was surprised to see both candidates didn't dominate headlines more. I was also surprised to see how CNN and Fox both spread their coverage relatively evenly between the two candidates. Though Trump's name was on the most headlines, only for NPR did he have nearly double the headlines. 

Overall, I could see how if you work out certain technical and methodoligical kinks - i.e: get to know the software better - then I think this tool could be a great work-horse resource. Especially for longterm projects.

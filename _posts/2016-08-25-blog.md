Week 10 Blog Post: The Buzz on Honey (Forgive me)

I've been thinking a lot about bees and honey.

Bees are fascinating creatures and, let's face it, honey is delicious. Also, the habitats of bees are going away (!!), so it is a real possibility that U.S. supply of honey could drop off. 

In the last 10 years, according to data from the USDA, average U.S. honey bee production is hovering at at average of about 158,000 pounds. The heighest production has gotten in the last decade is nearly 180,000 in 2014 and the lowest it's gotten is around 150,000 in 2007. 

Interestingly, demand has decreased in the last few years and so the price has been steadily increasing. Right now, the heighest the price of honey has gotten in the last 10 years was in 2014 (there's no 2016 data) where the average price was $2.17 a pound. According to my regression analysis, if the price hits just $3.36, the demand will drop off.
